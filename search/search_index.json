This means the code is transparent, the algorithm is auditable, and the project will always remain free from commercial interests.</p> <p>We believe learning tools shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or subject to the whims of venture capital. Education is a public good, and the tools that support it should be too.</p> <p>For the technically curious: Exam Turtle implements the FSRS algorithm with topic-level granularity rather than card-level. This allows for more flexible study materials while maintaining the mathematical rigor of spaced repetition research.

Passive review is simply re-reading the book title. Active Recall is being asked a question and successfully pulling that book off the shelf. Every time you successfully pull the book (recall the information), you make the path to that shelf wider and easier to navigate the next time. This process:</p> <ul> <li>Strengthens Memory: It creates a stronger, more durable memory trace.</li> <li>Identifies Gaps: It immediately highlights what you don't know, allowing you to focus your limited energy precisely where it\u2019s needed.</li> </ul> <p>Since Exam Turtle focuses on topics (complex theories, essays, proofs) rather than simple flashcards, we need strategies that match that complexity.
