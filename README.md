# 🐢 Exam Turtle

> *Slow and steady wins the race.*

As much as we love cramming, turtles are the way to go for exams. Exam Turtle brings the proven science of spaced repetition to **topics** instead of flashcards—perfect for subjects that don't fit the traditional card format.

## Why Turtles?

Learning isn't about intensity; it's about **consistency**. Complex theories, mathematical proofs, essay topics, case studies—these require a different approach than simple Q&A cards. Exam Turtle applies spaced repetition to any topic you're studying, adapting to your individual learning patterns over time.

## How It Works

- **Add your study topics** from any subject
- **Review honestly** - rate how well you understood each topic
- **Trust the algorithm** - powered by FSRS research, it learns your memory patterns
- **Stay consistent** - small, regular reviews compound over time

The app works better the more honest you are with it. When you rate a topic as "Hard," you're not being harsh—you're teaching the system about your learning patterns so it can help you more effectively.

## Philosophy

**Values we believe in:**
- **Honesty** — Progress comes from accurate self-assessment  
- **Kindness** — Learning should encourage, not punish
- **Simplicity** — Complexity is the enemy of consistency
- **Sustainability** — Small efforts over unsustainable bursts

## Open Source

Exam Turtle is free and open source under GNU GPL v3. We believe learning tools should be public goods, not profit centers. The code is transparent, the algorithm is auditable, and it will always remain free.

## Getting Started
Work in progress :>

Start slow. Add a few topics. Be honest about your understanding. Review consistently, not intensively. Trust the process. Get good rest, eat well, and take breaks.

The race isn't won by who studies hardest—it's won by who studies smartest.
