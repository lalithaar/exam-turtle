# 🐢 Exam Turtle

> *Slow and steady wins the race.*

As much as we love cramming, turtles are the way to go for exams. Exam Turtle embodies the timeless wisdom of Aesop's fable—when you take it slow, rest well, nourish yourself, and study consistently, you perform far better than frantic last-minute efforts.

## The Philosophy

Learning isn't about grinding harder; it's about **caring for yourself** while building consistent patterns. Your brain performs best when you're well-rested, properly fed, and approaching study with a calm, steady rhythm.

Unlike traditional flashcard systems, Exam Turtle works with **topics**—perfect for complex theories, mathematical proofs, essay topics, and case studies that simply don't fit the flashcard format.

## How to run the app?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lalithaar/exam-turtle
cd exam-turtle
python3 app.py
```

## What Makes This Different

**Topic-Based Learning:** Complex subjects require more than Q&A cards. Exam Turtle applies spaced repetition to any topic you're studying, regardless of format.

**Active Recall Focus:** We don't mean passively re-reading notes. True review means actively retrieving information from memory without looking at your materials first.

**Honest Self-Assessment:** The algorithm learns your individual memory patterns when you honestly rate your understanding. "Hard" isn't harsh—it's accurate data that helps the system help you.

**Exam Pressure Modeling:** Unlike other tools, Exam Turtle understands that exam stress affects recall and schedules accordingly.

## How It Works

1. **Add your study topics** from any subject or course
2. **Review through active recall** - explain concepts, solve problems, teach others
3. **Rate honestly** - how well did you understand without looking at notes?
4. **Trust the algorithm** - powered by FSRS research, it learns your patterns
5. **Stay consistent** - small, regular reviews while taking care of yourself

The system tracks your retention patterns and schedules reviews when you're most likely to forget—the optimal moment for reinforcement. The intervals give you time to sleep, eat well, and live your life while your brain consolidates memories.

## Our Values

- **Self-Care** — Learning thrives when you take care of your whole self
- **Honesty** — Progress comes from accurate, kind self-assessment  
- **Sustainability** — Consistent care over unsustainable grinding
- **Rest** — Your brain consolidates memories during downtime
- **Nourishment** — Good food, sleep, and movement fuel learning
- **Patience** — Deep understanding takes time to develop
- **Transparency** — You deserve to understand how your learning works

## Open Source, Open Future

Exam Turtle is free and open source under GNU General Public License v3. This means the code is transparent, the algorithm is auditable, and the project will always remain free from commercial interests.

We believe learning tools shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or subject to the whims of venture capital. Education is a public good, and the tools that support it should be too.

## Technical Details

For the technically curious: Exam Turtle implements the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm with topic-level granularity rather than card-level. This allows for more flexible study materials while maintaining the mathematical rigor of spaced repetition research.

The system includes:
- Realistic forgetting curves with interference modeling
- Cognitive load management and burnout prevention
- Exam pressure simulation and stress impact
- Adaptive parameter learning from your performance patterns

## Getting Started

*Work in progress* 🚧

## Start Slow, Take Care, Finish Strong

Like the turtle in the fable, Exam Turtle doesn't promise overnight success. What it offers is something better: a sustainable system that honors your wellbeing while building deep, lasting knowledge.

Begin with just a few topics. Get enough sleep. Eat nourishing food. Take breaks. Be honest about your understanding. Review consistently, not intensively. Trust the process—and trust yourself.

The race isn't won by who grinds hardest—it's won by who takes the best care of themselves while learning steadily.

*Salutations to the Goddess who dwells in all beings in the form of intelligence.*

Intelligence is not ours to claim—it flows through us when we create the right conditions: rest, nourishment, consistency, and care.
