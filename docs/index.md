# Exam Turtle
## Free & open-source[^1], spaced repetition[^2] app for deep topic-based[^3] learning.
#### *Slow and steady wins the race.*


As much as we love cramming, turtles are the way to go for exams. Exam Turtle embodies the timeless wisdom of Aesop's fableâ€”when you take it slow, rest well, nourish yourself, and study consistently, you perform far better than frantic last-minute efforts.
